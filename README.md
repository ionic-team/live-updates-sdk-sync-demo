# live-updates-sdk-sync-demo

This app is a demo showing how to sync using the [Live Updates SDK](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.ionic/liveupdates). It syncs multiple apps down in two ways:

- All at once: all apps provided to the SDK and it handles all the downloading
- Staggered: app IDs synced over time

This demonstrates potential time differences in the different methods.
